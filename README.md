# The Wave 
## Summary
The Wave is a feature-rich social network for [fanfiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction) writers. It aims to bring
some of the best features from the best similar platforms out there, while also bringing over the social-media aspects
to allow the users freely communicate and share their awesome works 
all while making new friends!
## The Team
Well, currently there is only [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentine-sokolovskiy-b9256b219) doing the programming side
and my best friend I met on a fanfiction website once, who inspred the whole idea.
